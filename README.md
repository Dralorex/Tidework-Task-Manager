# Tidework Task Manager

Collaborative task management where urgency rises with due dates — nested folders, claimable tasks, roles, friends, and private chats.

## Features (v1)

- **Auth** — username + password; optional email for password reset
- **Workspaces** — many per user; roles: Owner, Admin, Editor, Member
- **Folders & tasks** — nested folders (name required); priority + due date urgency edge
- **Claim & calendar** — pick up tasks; due dates sync to your in-app calendar
- **Review flow** — members complete with a comment; Owner/Admin review
- **Tags** — public tags (Editor+); private tags after claiming a task
- **Search** — name relevance + tag filters in the current folder area
- **Invites** — Owner/Admin invite by username or email
- **Archive** — Admin+ soft-delete workspaces/folders with visibility (everyone / by role / specific people); history preserved
- **Folder ACL** — custom workspace roles; folders can require roles (Owner/Admin bypass); hide or show locked folders
- **Folder templates** — starter trees (Simple / Project / Team) plus save/reuse workspace folder layouts
- **Calendar** — list/month views; drag personal, task, and workspace items between days
- **Weekly digest** — optional email summary of overdue / due soon / reviews (Alerts → send preview)
- **Chat task links** — type `#` in chat to attach a task; messages render deep links into the folder
- **Presence** — online dots and “is typing…” via SSE (`/api/chat/[groupId]/presence`), with poll fallback
- **Social** — friends; DMs (friends free; workspace DMs need accept); Admin+ group chats
